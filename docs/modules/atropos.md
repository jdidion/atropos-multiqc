[Atropos](http://github.com/jdidion/atropos) began as a fork of [Cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt) with the goal of adding multi-threading support. Since then, we have added a new algorithm for identifying adapters in paired-end reads that greatly improves both sensitivity and specificity, along with many other features. Please see the [documentation](atropos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a full list of features.

The Atropos module parses JSON-formatted summaries that are generated by versions of Atropos starting with 1.1.0. The Atropos module acutally consists of three submodules: 1) trimming statistics, 2) pre-trimming QC statistics, and 3) post-trimming QC statistics. The pre- and post-trimming statistics are directly inspired by FastQC, thus we borrow much of the code from the FastQC module.
